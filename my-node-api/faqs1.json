    "question": "Which parameters are provided by PAKID Single Sign-On to organizations?",
    "answer": "The PAK ID SSO provides a verified set of profile attributes to the relying party (organization) after successful authentication. It is important to note that PAK ID SSO is a standardized authentication service designed to verify users and share only essential, validated “profile data” required for authentication purposes. Organizations that require access to additional citizen data fields or full identity verification should request NADRA’s dedicated eKYC services, which are separate from the SSO offering and subject to additional user consent and authorization mechanisms.\n                                                    Upon successful authentication, the following set of attributes is returned to the integrated organization:\n                                                    \n                                                        First Name – As provided by the user during the onboarding process\n                                                        Last Name – As provided by the user during the onboarding process\n                                                        Citizen Number – Verified Citizen Number of User\n                                                        Mobile Number – Verified via OTP during the onboarding process\n                                                        Email Address – Verified through OTP during the onboarding process"

  {
    "question": "Will citizen data be provided by PAK ID Single Sign-On (SSO) to organizations?",
    "answer": "No, PAK ID SSO is a standardized authentication product, not a data-sharing service. It is designed solely to verify that a user is a legitimate, authenticated and verified citizen of Pakistan. Upon successful authentication, it only returns set of verified profile attributes, including:\n                                                    \n                                                        First Name\n                                                        Last Name\n                                                        Verified CNIC Number\n                                                        Verified Mobile Number\n                                                        Verified Email Address"
  },
  {
    "question": "How can an organization access citizen data fields through the Digital Identity ecosystem?",
    "answer": "Organizations that require access to verified citizen data fields must use the MyInfo product. PAK ID SSO is a mandatory prerequisite for MyInfo, as it provides the authentication framework and enables consent notifications to be sent to the citizen’s registered and authorized device. Only after explicit consent is obtained from the citizen can the requested data fields be securely shared. Therefore, whenever the MyInfo service is offered to an organization for data sharing with consent management, integration with NADRA's PAK ID SSO must be enforced as a foundational requirement."
  },
  {
    "question": "Is PAKID SSO available for integration with both Web-Based and mobile platforms?",
    "answer": "Yes, PAK ID SSO is designed to support integration with both web and mobile-based platforms. It utilizes industry-standard authentication protocols, such as OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect (OIDC), ensuring interoperability with modern web/mobile application frameworks, as well as identity management systems. For mobile-based platforms, NADRA provides a specialized SDK to organizations integrating with PAK ID for SSO functionality. This SDK is available for both iOS and Android platforms."

    "answer": "The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) defines verifiable credentials as a standardized data model that facilitates the expression of credentials in a way that is cryptographically secure, privacy-respecting, and machine-verifiable. This model allows for the digital representation of information found in physical credentials, like passports or driver's licenses, as well as new types of credentials without physical counterparts."
